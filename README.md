# Polifonia Ontology Network

This repository contains links to the Polifonia Ontology Network.

A root ontology module (FULL), stored in this repository, imports all thematic ontology modules of the ontology network.

Thematic and top-level ontology modules are stored elsewhere in their own repositories, and linked here.

## Ontology modules of Polifonia Ontology Network

| Ontology | Description | Link | Champion |
|----------|-------------|------|----------|
| FULL |  The FULL root ontology module is stored in this repository. |  https://github.com/polifonia-project/ontology-network/ | WP2 |
| Core | The ontology models general-purpose concepts and relationships (e.g. place, time, classification, situation) orthogonal to the whole Polifonia ontology network  | https://github.com/polifonia-project/core/  | Valentina Carriero  |
| Musical Performance | The ontology models concepts and relationships for representing musical performances and music-related events.  |  https://github.com/polifonia-project/musical-performance/ | Valentina Carriero  |
| Musical Composition | The ontology models concepts and relationships for representing musical compositions.  |  https://github.com/polifonia-project/musical-composition/ |  WP2 |
| Musical Feature | The ontology provides a comprehensive and sound schema to describe a musical object (a score, an audio track, etc.) in regard to the musical properties that can be objectively attributed or subjectively identified from it.  | https://github.com/polifonia-project/musical-feature/  |  Valentina Carriero |
| Source |  The ontology models concepts and relationships for representing sources of (music-related) information. |  https://github.com/polifonia-project/source |  Fiorela Ciroku |
| Instrument |  The ontology describe musical instruments, their categorisation into instrument families and groups, and their technical properties. | https://github.com/polifonia-project/instrument  | Fiorela Ciroku  |
| Comparative Measure | The ontology models observations and measures applied to comparative analysis, such as similarities.  |  https://github.com/polifonia-project/comparative-measure | Fiorela Ciroku  |
| Music Emotion | The ontology provides a comprehensive and sound schema to describe emotions both perceived and induced by a composition in regard to the musical features.  |  https://github.com/polifonia-project/music-emotion | WP2  |
| Metadata |  The ontology aims at supporting the representation of meta-data about musical resources. |  https://github.com/polifonia-project/metadata | WP2  |
| Bell |  The ontology represents concepts and relationships to describe bells, bell towers and bell ringers. |  https://github.com/polifonia-project/bell |  Valentina Carriero |
| JAMS |  The ontology provides a comprehensive schema to describe JAMS files and their annotations. | https://github.com/polifonia-project/jams-ontology  |  Andrea Poltronieri |
| Roman Chords | The ontology represents annotated chords in the Roman Numeral format  | https://github.com/polifonia-project/roman-chord-ontology  | Andrea Poltronieri  |
| Organs |   |  https://github.com/polifonia-project/organs-dataset | Fiorela Ciroku  |
| Modal Tonalities |  Ontology dedicated to the modal-tonal organisation of polyphonic works. | https://github.com/polifonia-project/modal-tonal-ontology  |   |



## Ontology and dataset survey

A survey (included as part of D2.1) reporting existing ontologies with relations to the PON is avaialble [here](d21-ontologies.pdf), and an analogous one about related datasets is [here](d21-datasets.pdf)
