Providing the definition of a musical concept, when possible, requires a meticoulus that is very hard even for experts of that field.

It is inherently impossibile to find a uniquely and objectively correct definition of ",(0,i.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"chord")," since it is deeply rooted in the context in which such ",(0,i.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"chord")," will be used in the first place."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"While currently we might refer to a ",(0,i.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"chord")," as a stack of notes played at the same time, the same definition does not apply when one wants to study music from the Renaissance.
