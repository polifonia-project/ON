Despite its popularity, an unambigous definition for chord is still distiputed and on going research is focused in finding such definition.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"music-representation/intro":{"id":"music-representation/intro","title":"Introduction","description":"The music domain landscape is populated by a large number of representation systems that serve different purposes.

Your digital score is using some unconventional notation? Then MEI is what you are looking for. And if you just need a simple way of notating a musical piece, Lead sheet can help, or perhaps ABC notation. Writing chords in natural language can be very confusing though. Harte notation can really rescue you, and if you are theoretically-inclined, using Roman Numerals can bring a whole new level of knowledge to your notation.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
